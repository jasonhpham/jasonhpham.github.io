    <h3>BREAKER (IN DEVELOPMENT)</h3>
    <p>
      BREAKER is an in-development speedrunning FPS made within Unreal where the only objectives are adrenaline and revenge.
      The intended experience is a fast-paced arena movement shooter with an emphasis on speedrunning.
      I am currently working as a gameplay programmer, implementing the weapon and ability systems from designer prototypes and documents.

    <h3>CollegeCookingWare (March-June 2025)</h3>
    <p>
      CollegeCookingWare is a themed minigame collection game where players take on the role of a struggling college student trying to cook struggle meals
      while managing their social and academic life, each represented through fast-paced minigames. This Project was built in Godot using GDScript.
      My role within the project was a gameplay programmer and technical artist, integrating art/audio assets, programming the logic for 10 minigames, and composing the game's soundtrack.

    <h3>The Murder of Master Roberts (March-June 2025)</h3>
    <p>
      The Murder of Master Roberts is a text-based murder mystery built in HTML and JavaScript using Twine where players take the role of a detective investigating the death of the eccentric billionaire Mr. Roberts.
      Players have the option to interrogate a cast of 7 different characters, gathering clues along the way and discerning red herrings to discover the true murderer.
      My role within the project was a gameplay programmer, integrating a Google Sheets API in JavaScript that tracked decisions, time spent, and paths taken across playthroughs.
      Me and my group then applied this data to answer questions that we had about player behavior in our game.

    <h3>Grand Prix (October-December 2024)</h3>
    <p>
      Grand Prix is a fast-paced, pub-style card game where players strategically time their moves to outmaneuver opponents and claim victory in intense 1v1 races, intending to recreate the "casual" tension of games like Skull and Uno.
      Each turn, players choose to draw cards, prepare for their next challenge, or initiate a Grand Prix, attempting to defeat every opponent in a sequential series of races.
      Players engage in bluffing mechanics by predicting whether their opponent’s face-down card is higher, lower, or the same as theirs, with correct calls adding to their Prize Pool, while incorrect calls result in losing all
      played cards. Ties up the ante, forcing players to continue racing neck and neck until a clear winner emerges, while some cards feature special abilities that activate during ties that can pull a player ahead.
      Players can also Back Down from a Grand Prix attempt to minimize risk, and cut their losses.
      The game supports 3-6 players, lasts 15-30 minutes, and requires a mix of resource management, deduction, and high-stakes decision-making, making every match tense, rewarding, and highly replayable for
      players of all kinds who enjoy a competitive, yet welcoming experience. On this project, I worked as a co-game designer, and also created all digital graphics for the game, including cards and cover art.</p>

    <h3>Landlord Simulator (March-June 2024)</h3>
    <p>Landlord Simulator is a management simulator, where players take on the role of well, a landlord.
    As a landlord, you have to balance factors such as tenant satisfaction, rent, upgrades, and the surprises life brings you (a pipe explosion).  This game features tenant interactions, financial management, and a week-based progression system, along with randomly generated events to keep things engaging.
    With this game, our group sought out to make something as mundane as being a landlord, fun.
      My contributions to the project include designing the game's systems, and programing them within Unity.</p>

    <h3>Lost To Space (February-June 2024)</h3>
    <p>Lost to Space is a 2D survival sandbox, where you play as a marooned astronaut part of the Reconnaissance for Earth's Survival (R.E.S.) program.
      Players must navigate a procedurally generated, looping world, utilizing movement abilities, mining and placing blocks, managing inventory, engaging in combat,
      and facing enemies (big and small slimes!) to survive.
      As part of the development team, I contributed to the game's programming, focusing on implementing core mechanics such as the movement system, enemy AI behavior, and the combat framework.</p>

    <h3>Virtual Vendetta (February-March 2024)</h3>
    <p>Virtual Vendetta is a short-card cyberpunk-inspired deck-building card battler, where your goal is to beat the champion of the metro.
    Standing in your way though, lays a path of enemies that you have to take down, each with their own deck designs and behaviors.
      As a player, you have a vast arsenal of cards that you can buy and customize your deck with, choosing either to duke it out on your own,
      or possibly set up deadly synergies with your partner.
    Virtual Vendetta is a local 2-player game, with the option for a single player experience with an AI companion.
    My contributions to the project include gameplay programming, coding all card interactions and types, AI, and status effects. I also
      contributed to the overall combat design of the game.</p>
