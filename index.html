    <h3>Grand Prix (October-December 2024)</h3>
    <p>
      Grand Prix is a fast-paced, pub-style card game where players strategically time their moves to outmaneuver opponents and claim victory in intense 1v1 races, intending to recreate the "casual" tension of games like Skull and Uno.
      Each turn, players choose to draw cards, prepare for their next challenge, or initiate a Grand Prix, attempting to defeat every opponent in a sequential series of races.
      Players engage in bluffing mechanics by predicting whether their opponent’s face-down card is higher, lower, or the same as theirs, with correct calls adding to their Prize Pool, while incorrect calls result in losing all
      played cards. Ties up the ante, forcing players to continue racing neck and neck until a clear winner emerges, while some cards feature special abilities that activate during ties that can pull a player ahead.
      Players can also Back Down from a Grand Prix attempt to minimize risk, and cut their losses.
      The game supports 3-6 players, lasts 15-30 minutes, and requires a mix of resource management, deduction, and high-stakes decision-making, making every match tense, rewarding, and highly replayable for
      players of all kinds who enjoy a competitive, yet welcoming experience. On this project, I worked as a co-game designer, and also created all digital graphics for the game, including cards and cover art.</p>
